# Home automation
An app I've made in Flutter that allows me to connect to the embedded devices that I create!

From the app you can create rooms, and within rooms you can create devices.
For now only my [camera](https://github.com/Angelo13C/camera) device is supported, but I've made things in such a way that if I wanted, I could easily add new devices.
You can rename and delete rooms, and also you can delete devices.
